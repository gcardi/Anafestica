# Anafestica Test Plan

This document describes how to run tests, configuration rules, and current test coverage.

## 1. Build and run tests

The three C++Builder `.cbproj` test projects are built and run with MSBuild
using the provided `test_all.bat` script.

```powershell
test_all.bat                        # build + run all three compilers
test_all.bat bcc64x                 # build + run bcc64x only
test_all.bat bcc32c bcc64           # build + run two toolchains
test_all.bat --rebuild              # force full recompile for all three
test_all.bat --no-build             # skip build, run existing executables only
test_all.bat --stop-on-error        # abort on first failure
```

The build is incremental by default (MSBuild `/t:Make`); use `--rebuild` to
force a full recompile (`/t:Build`). The script calls `rsvars.bat` to set up
the Embarcadero environment, builds all selected targets first, then runs the
tests only if all builds succeeded:

| Project | Platform | Compiler | Executable |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `Test\TestBcc32c\anafestica_test_bcc32c.cbproj` | Win32 | bcc32c | `Win32\Release\anafestica_test_bcc32c.exe` |
| `Test\TestBcc64\anafestica_test_bcc64.cbproj` | Win64 | bcc64 | `Win64\Release\anafestica_test_bcc64.exe` |
| `Test\TestBcc64x\anafestica_test_bcc64x.cbproj` | Win64x | bcc64x | `Win64x\Release\anafestica_test_bcc64x.exe` |

At the end it prints a summary with pass/fail/skip counts and exits with
a non-zero code if any test suite failed.

### Cleaning build artifacts

To remove all test build output directories, use the `clear_tests.bat` script:

```powershell
clear_tests.bat                     # clean all three toolchains
clear_tests.bat bcc64x              # clean bcc64x only
clear_tests.bat bcc32c bcc64        # clean two toolchains
```

This deletes the `Win32`, `Win64`, and/or `Win64x` output directories under
each test project folder. It does not require MSBuild or `rsvars.bat`.

## 2. Runtime requirements for test suite

- Windows
- C++Builder with RTL/VCL support
- Boost unit_test_framework
- HKCU registry write permission (required by registry tests)

---

## 3. Current coverage for `TConfigNodeValueType`

`TConfigNodeValueType` holds **21 alternatives on bcc64x** (std::variant path, Clang ≥ 15)
and **19 alternatives on bcc64/bcc32c** (boost::variant path) — the two C++ string types
are absent there because Boost 1.70's `mpl::list` is hardcoded to a 20-type limit:

- int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, char, unsigned char, short, unsigned short
- long long, unsigned long long, bool, System::String
- System::TDateTime, float, double, System::Currency
- StringCont (`std::vector<String>`), System::Sysutils::TBytes, BytesCont (`std::vector<Byte>`)
- **std::string** (UTF-8, tag `str`) — bcc64x only
- **std::wstring** (UTF-16, tag `wstr`) — bcc64x only

`Test/TestBcc64x/test_types.cpp` covers low-level registry primitives (QWORD, MultiSz, binary, expand-string).

`Test/TestBcc64x/test_config.cpp` covers full roundtrip through all four backends for all 21 types (bcc64x).
`Test/TestBcc64/test_config.cpp` covers the same four backends for the 19 common types (bcc64).

| Tag | Type | Registry | JSON | XML | INI |
| --- | ---- | :------: | :--: | :-: | :-: |
| `i` | int | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `u` | unsigned int | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `l` | long | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `ul` | unsigned long | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `c` | char | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `uc` | unsigned char | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `s` | short | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `us` | unsigned short | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `ll` | long long | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `ull` | unsigned long long | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `b` | bool | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `sz` | System::String | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `dt` | System::TDateTime | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `flt` | float | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `dbl` | double | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `cur` | System::Currency | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `sv` | StringCont (vector\<String\>) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `dab` | TBytes | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `vb` | BytesCont (vector\<Byte\>) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `str` | std::string (UTF-8) — bcc64x only | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `wstr` | std::wstring (UTF-16) — bcc64x only | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

`Test/TestBcc64x/test_config.cpp` also includes explicit enum roundtrip tests for all
four backends:

- `Registry_enum_roundtrip`
- `JSON_enum_roundtrip`
- `INIFile_enum_roundtrip`
- `XML_enum_roundtrip`

`string_view` / `wstring_view` write-convenience overloads are also tested for all four backends (bcc64x only).

### Type-mismatch tests

`Test/TestBcc64x/test_type_mismatch.cpp` (shared with the bcc64 target) verifies that reading a value with a C++ type
that differs from the type tag stored by the backend silently returns the
default-initialised value (`T{}`).  The variant alternative written by
`PutItem<A>()` does not match the `std::get_if<B>()` performed by
`GetItem<B>()`, so the assignment is skipped and the caller gets `T{}`.

Five representative mismatch pairs are tested across all four backends:

| Stored as | Read as | Why |
| --------- | ------- | --- |
| `int` (−42) | `double` | Two numeric types that users can confuse, but they are distinct variant alternatives |
| `String` ("Hello") | `int` | String-to-numeric: common real-world mistake (value has tag `sz`, code reads as `i`) |
| `int` (−42) | `String` | Reverse direction: numeric stored, code expects a string |
| `bool` (true) | `int` | C++ converts bool↔int implicitly, but the variant treats them as separate alternatives |
| `double` (3.14…) | `float` | Closely related FP types, easy to mix up, yet distinct in the variant |

## 4. Quick checklist

- [x] `test_all.bat` passes all three compilers
- [x] All 21 variant types covered (bcc64x) / 19 variant types (bcc64, bcc32c) across Registry, JSON, XML, and INI backends
- [x] Enum roundtrip covered across Registry, JSON, XML, and INI backends
- [x] Type-mismatch silent-default behaviour covered across all four backends
